# Web based image classifier.
This is a simple web based image classifier. In this application, one can train the model using their images taken from webcam in three different classes. The trained model predicts the type of class along with the probabilty when a similar pose is recreated.

A pretrained MobileNet model is used for image classification. This model is modified to classify the images into three custom classes.
